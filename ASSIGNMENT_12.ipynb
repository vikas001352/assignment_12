    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, it is said to be \"raised.\" Python provides a mechanism to handle exceptions, allowing you to catch and respond to these exceptional events gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "They typically arise due to logical errors, unexpected conditions, or external factors like input/output operations.\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, IndexError, etc.\n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing you to handle the exceptional conditions and prevent your program from crashing.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code syntax.\n",
    "They occur during the parsing (or compilation) stage before the program is executed.\n",
    "Syntax errors indicate violations of the language's grammar rules and can include missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, misspelled keywords, etc.\n",
    "Since syntax errors prevent the interpreter from understanding the code, they must be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "In summary, exceptions occur during program execution when unexpected conditions or errors arise, while syntax errors occur during the parsing stage due to invalid code syntax. Exceptions can be caught and handled, while syntax errors must be fixed before running the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it leads to what is called an \"unhandled exception.\" In such cases, the program terminates abruptly, and an error message is displayed, providing information about the exception that occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, you'll encounter the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 7, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "    result = a / b\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows a traceback, indicating the sequence of function calls that led to the exception. The program execution stops at the line where the exception occurred, and the error message provides details about the exception type (ZeroDivisionError) and the specific cause (division by zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, since the exception was not handled, the program terminates abruptly, and any subsequent code after the exception is not executed. Properly handling exceptions allows you to respond to exceptional conditions in a controlled manner and prevents your program from crashing unexpectedly.\n",

    "n Python, you can use the try-except statements to handle exceptions and prevent them from causing your program to crash. The try block is used to enclose the code that may raise an exception, and the except block is used to specify how to handle the exception if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of try-except statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",

    "        print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "result = divide_numbers(num1, num2)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "n this example, we have modified the previous divide_numbers function to include exception handling using the try-except statements. Inside the try block, the code attempts to divide a by b. If a ZeroDivisionError exception occurs, the program jumps to the corresponding except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, you'll encounter the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Error: Division by zero is not allowed!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the exception is caught by the except ZeroDivisionError block, and the error message is displayed instead of the program crashing. The program continues execution after the except block, allowing you to handle the exceptional condition gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using try-except statements, you can catch specific exceptions and provide appropriate error handling or recovery mechanisms. Additionally, you can include multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately, allowing for more fine-grained exception handling in your code.\n",

    "In this example, we have updated the divide_numbers function to include the else and finally blocks along with the try and except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code inside the try block attempts to divide a by b.\n",
    "If a ZeroDivisionError exception occurs, the program jumps to the except block, which prints an error message.\n",
    "If no exception occurs, the program proceeds to the else block, which executes code that depends on the successful execution of the try block. In this case, it prints the division result.\n",
    "Regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, the finally block always executes. This block is useful for performing cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "When you run this code, you'll encounter the following output:\n",

Instead of using general-purpose exceptions, you can define custom exceptions that convey specific information about the error, making it easier to handle and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application-Specific Exceptions: In some cases, your application may require unique exceptions that are not covered by the built-in exceptions provided by Python. Custom exceptions allow you to define and raise application-specific errors, providing more meaningful and tailored error messages to the users or developers interacting with your code.\n",
